Something appears to be wrong with display of lingtypology map and everything below it in my .ipynb notebook (everything is saved in raw text, though).
Notebook should be trusted to view it, you can see everything by this link: https://nbviewer.org/github/romtar2000/romtartax/blob/main/Final_project.ipynb
